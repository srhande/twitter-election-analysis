# Sentiment Analysis of Tweets Regarding the Upcoming 2020 Presidential Election

In this project, we use sentiment analysis to determine the US's feelings regarding the [2020 Presidential Race Candidates](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2019/us/politics/2020-presidential-candidates.html).

This project is based off [this paper from Stanford](https://web.stanford.edu/~jesszhao/files/twitterSentiment.pdf), where the researchers analyzed sentiments of tweets from the 2016 Presidential Election.

We hope to predict the outcome of the 2020 Presidential Election using public sentiment towards each of the candidates.
